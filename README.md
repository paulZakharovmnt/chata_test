# Chata Frontend Coding Challenge

## Create a cocktail recipe book!

Your goal for this challenge is to create a "recipe book" for cocktails based on their alcohol ingredient. The user should be able to browse different recipes based on their ingredient, and get more detailed information on the cocktail of their choosing.

## Getting Started

To start this challenge, simply clone or fork this repo. When making changes, feel free to organize your code however you like. You can move files around and create new folders and files based off your own organizational structure preferences.

If you prefer to use a different framework than React or none at all, feel free to start your own project from scratch. This will not affect your evaluation.

## The Cocktail Data

You will be using "TheCocktailDB" API.

All necessary documentation for this API can be found here https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php?ref=apilist.fun

It will be up to you to choose which methods you want to use to complete the task.

`Note: You will not need to use any of the methods that require Patreon support`

## Challenge Requirements

1. Choose 5 or more different alcohol ingredients (eg. rum, vodka, gin, etc.) and create a tab for each type of alcohol
2. In each tab, display the full list of cocktails for that specific ingredient. The way you choose to display this list is up to you.
3. A user should be able to click on a cocktail to get more detailed information about it. The way you display this information and the type of information you want to display is up to you. For example, you could show the recipe details by expanding the list item to show underneath the title, or you could open up a modal with the recipe, etc.

Feel free to use any 3rd party libraries of your choice

## Tips

- As with any project, it is good to have a solid plan in place before diving into the code. Creating a simple mockup or wireframe of your design could help save time with this challenge
- Don't try to reinvent the wheel!
- Think componentization and reusability

## Submission Instructions

Please submit your project to nmoore@chata.ai by 11:59pm on Sunday, Jan 31, 2021. If you have any additional design files or planning documents please send those as well.

If you can not complete this challenge within the given time frame, please submit any work that you have. There will be multiple factors considered in our evaluation, so an incomplete project doesn't necessarily equal a bad evaluation.

Thank you for taking the time to take part in this challenge. We look forward to seeing your project!
